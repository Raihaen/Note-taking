# This a super basic note taking app

The only reason I made this was to eliminate distractions and allow me to take my notes in peace.
You can view ```.md``` files (text & math for now) and edit them, that is all!
This app only shows files inside the docs folder.
You can add a custom command to your linux or wsl system for quick access (this is what i did at least).

I will be adding a way to add folders/files in the next update.
